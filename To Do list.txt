1. Clean up the code.
2. Alternatives for median...find the distribution of the data which is used to predict a particular point and if it is a multi modal distribution -> pick mean, else median.
3. try aggregating the values according to granularity.
4. Round the values for all the periods.


Limitations of the code:
1. Works only if it is 20 periods..the errors..
2. The case in which there is a floating point exception. (like the one found in code) -> currently being handled manually 
^ Rounding the periods would do.
3. The data should be in 2 and 3rd columns of a .csv file.

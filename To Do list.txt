1. Clean up the code and mak it standard.
2. pick the one with least error and plot only one graph..
3. Check if there is any error with HoltWinters -> giving weird plots!
4. Remove outliers..It might be its effecting the whole plot.
5. Algo of algo wrapper -> to be built. 
6. Check if HoltWinters is wrongly applied or something..If the trend is properly set or not.


Limitations of the code:
1. Works only if it is 20 periods..the errors..
2. The case in which there is a floating point exception. (like the one found in code) -> currently being handled manually 
^ Rounding the periods would do.
3. The data should be in 2 and 3rd columns of a .csv file.

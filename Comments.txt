1. variable name in prepare data function would be more specific to data.
2. for loop can be replace wwith which statement (line no. 14).
3. testdata, testdata2 can be store in single matrix(2, 2), same for traindata, traindata2.
4. calculate_errors_1 function name would be more specific.
5. calculate_errors_1 -> for loop can be replace with which statement.
5. calculate_errors_1 -> variable name RMSE, MAPE?
6. folder path should not be inside function(line 77).
7. fit_lm_plot function returns coef only what is the perpose of calculating RMSE ans MAPE then?
8. folder path in code line 1369.
9. line (1322 - 1503) code should be in in function.
10. 849, 850, 852 you can use variable direct no need to explicitly assign in local variable.
11. selecting best fit for given timesesies should be in function outside from for loop (it is generic to all timeseries).

GENERAL:
1. remove commented code from R file.
2. missing necessary exception catch in code incase of output folder not found, unable to write csv, timeseries data has null or na or different date format then used.
3. remove unnecessary print statement.
4. not clear what is happening in predict_next_bin_detrended function.
